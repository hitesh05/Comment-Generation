# Comment-Generation
## An Introduction of the project
An important aspect of the “YOU” search engine is the fact that it has been able to specifically
understand code.With that in mind, the project can be divided into two broad tasks: the first
would be to develop a classifier trained on code-comment relevance datasets, the second
would be to then use the insights from that classification task to create a text generation model
that generates comments based on given code.
