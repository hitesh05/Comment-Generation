abstract="During software maintenance, developers spend a lot of time understanding the source code. Existing studies show that code comments help developers comprehend programs and reduce additional time spent on reading and navigating source code. Unfortunately, these comments are often mismatched, missing or outdated in software projects. Developers have to infer the functionality from the source code. This paper proposes a new approach named Hybrid-DeepCom to automatically generate code comments for the functional units of Java language, namely, Java methods. The generated comments aim to help developers understand the functionality of Java methods. Hybrid-DeepCom applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to learn from a large code corpus and generates comments from learned features. It formulates the comment generation task as the machine translation problem. Hybrid-DeepCom exploits a deep neural network that combines the lexical and structure information of Java methods for better comments generation. We conduct experiments on a large-scale Java corpus built from 9,714 open source projects on GitHub. We evaluate the experimental results on both machine translation metrics and information retrieval metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method Hybrid-DeepCom outperforms the state-of-the-art by a substantial margin. In addition, we evaluate the influence of out-of-vocabulary tokens on comment generation. The results show that reducing the out-of-vocabulary tokens improves the accuracy effectively.",

    abstract = "Sequence to Sequence Neural Machine Translation has achieved significant performance in recent years. Yet, there are some existing issues that Neural Machine Translation still does not solve completely. Two of them are translation for long sentences and the {``}over-translation{''}. To address these two problems, we propose an approach that utilize more grammatical information such as syntactic dependencies, so that the output can be generated based on more abundant information. In our approach, syntactic dependencies is employed in decoding. In addition, the output of the model is presented not as a simple sequence of tokens but as a linearized tree construction. In order to assess the performance, we construct model based on an attention mechanism encoder-decoder model in which the source language is input to the encoder as a sequence and the decoder generates the target language as a linearized dependency tree structure. Experiments on the Europarl-v7 dataset of French-to-English translation demonstrate that our proposed method improves BLEU scores by 1.57 and 2.40 on datasets consisting of sentences with up to 50 and 80 tokens, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method also solved the two existing problems, ineffective translation for long sentences and over-translation in Neural Machine Translation.",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach ContextCC to automatically generate concise comments for Java methods based on neural networks, leveraging techniques of program analysis and natural language processing. Firstly, ContextCC employs program analysis techniques, especially abstract syntax tree parsing, to extract context information including methods and their dependency. Secondly, it filters code and comments out of the context information to build up a high-quality data set based on a set of pre-defined templates and rules. Finally, ContextCC trains a code comment generation model based on recurrent neural networks. Experiments are conducted on Java projects crawled from GitHub. We show empirically that the performance of ContextCC is superior to state-of-the-art baseline methods."
